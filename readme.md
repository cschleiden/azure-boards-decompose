**2021/4/1 - I have stopped support for all my Azure DevOps extensions and unpublished them from the marketplace**

# VSTS Quick Decompose #

This extension allows you to quickly decompose a work item into a valid hierarchy. Example:

![Decompose item into hierarchy](marketplace/quick-decompose.gif?raw=true)


This is an example for using relatively modern web dev technologies to build a VSTS (https://www.visualstudio.com) extension. In contrast to my other seed project and example (https://github.com/cschleiden/vsts-extension-ts-seed-simple and https://github.com/cschleiden/vsts-extension-tags-mru) which focused on simplicity, this sample aims to be more complete. It supports:

- Code written in Typescript/Styling defined using SASS
- Publishing a dev version of an extension and a production one, without changing the manifest
- Webpack for watching and building files during development, and for building optimized bundles for production
- Unit tests of the core logic using mocha/chai
- React for rendering a complex UI with user interation

## Building ##

This extension uses *webpack* for bundling, *webpack-dev-server* for watching files and serving bundles during development, *mocha*, *chai* for writing unit tests, and *karma* as a test runner.

Two bundles are defined for webpack, one for the main dialog, one for the extension context menu registration. 

All actions can be triggered using npm scripts (`npm run <target>`), no additional task runner required.  

### General setup ###

You need

* node/npm

then just clone and execute `npm install`.

### Development ###

1. Run `npm run publish:dev` to publish the current extension manifest to the marketplace as a private extension with a suffix of `-dev` added to the extension id. This package will use a baseUri of `https://localhost:8080`. 

2. Run `npm run dev` to start a webpack developmen server that watches all source files. Tests live next to product code and use a `.tests.ts` suffix instead of only `.ts`.

3. To run a single test pass execute `npm run test`, to keep watching tests and build/execute as you develop execute `npm run dev:test`.

### Production ###

 1. Run `npm run publish:release` to compile all modules into bundles, package them into a .vsix, and publish as a *public* extension to the VSTS marketplace.
